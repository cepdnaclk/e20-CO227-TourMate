## Introduction

Travelers often struggle with organizing efficient, budget-friendly itineraries due to scattered information and limited personalized guidance, leading to time-consuming planning and potentially higher costs. Our tour guide app addresses this by providing tailored routes, accommodations, and schedules based on user preferences, enabling easy exploration and bookmarking of attractions, meals, and lodging. With automated route and timing calculations, the app saves users time and money while enriching their travel experience, allowing them to explore more effectively and with greater convenience.
